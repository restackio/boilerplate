## Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project and
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for the
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Showing respect for differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what benefits not just individuals, but the
  entire community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which reasonably appears inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers have responsibility for clarifying and enforcing these standards of
acceptable behavior and take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual officially represents the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing the community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at <service@restack.io>.
Community leaders review and investigate all complaints promptly and thoroughly.

All community leaders must respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.
