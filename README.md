# Restack boilerplate

This project uses [Restack](https://restack.io), the open source AI agent orchestration at enterprise scale.

## Motivation

Restack has helped enterprise companies build AI agents at large scale where product teams often sit between domain experts (customer service, marketing, sales) and engineering teams.

- **The challenge:** product teams wants to iterate quickly with domain experts to craft agent behavior and experience. But every change requires engineering coordination, creating bottlenecks that slow innovation.

- **Restack approach:** empowers product teams with full autonomy from engineering. Product collaborates directly with domain experts to refine agent behavior. Engineering focuses on what they do best: building reliable integrations with 99.99% SLAs.

Built on Python + Kubernetes because enterprises already run AI workloads this way. Works with your existing infrastructure and team expertise.

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` with a valid OpenAI API key
- Set `RESTACK_ENGINE_MCP_ADDRESS` for ngrok tunnel with `ngrok http 11233`

### First time setup
```bash
pnpm localsetup
```

This installs dependencies, starts infrastructure (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Restack), runs migrations, and inserts demo data.

### Start development
```bash
pnpm localdev
```

This starts infrastructure and all dev servers with hot reloading **without resetting your database**.

<details>
<summary>Manual setup (if you prefer step-by-step)</summary>

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start infrastructure (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Restack)
pnpm infra:start

# Wait for services to be ready, then run migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Insert demo data
pnpm db:demo:insert

# Start all dev servers
pnpm dev
```
</details>

### Access your platform
- **Agent Orchestration**: http://localhost:3000  
- **Developer Tracing**: http://localhost:5233
- **API**: http://localhost:8000
- **ClickHouse**: http://localhost:8123 (metrics and analytics)

**Performance tip:** development mode uses hot reloading. For faster page loads, use `pnpm build && pnpm start` instead of `pnpm localdev`.

## What can you build?

- **Customer Support Agents** (Zendesk, Intercom, Slack)  
Engineering connects support platforms. Product teams iterate on escalation rules, response tone, and handoff triggers.

- **Product Intelligence Agents** (PostHog, Linear, Slack)  
Engineering builds analytics and project management pipelines. Product teams adjust feature prioritization logic and user feedback analysis.

- **DevOps Monitoring Agents** (Sentry, Datadog, Kubernetes, GitHub, OpenAI Codex)  
Engineering integrates monitoring and development tools. Product teams define alert thresholds, incident response workflows, and automated troubleshooting.

- **Performance Marketing Agents** (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, PostHog, Slack)  
Engineering establishes advertising and analytics connections. Product teams optimize campaign strategies, bidding algorithms, and performance reporting.

- **Sales Intelligence Agents** (Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack)  
Engineering connects CRM and communication platforms. Product teams refine lead scoring, follow-up sequences, and sales forecasting models.

## Platform architecture

- **Product interface:** web-based agent management with version control, testing playground, and deployment controls. Product teams change agent behavior without code dependencies.

- **Engineering infrastructure:** python-based integration layer with [Temporal](https://temporal.io) workflow orchestration. [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) deployment with enterprise-grade reliability and observability.

- **Integration protocol:** [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) automatically exposes Python functions as agent tools, enabling seamless tool discovery and use across agent workflows.

## OpenAI setup

This boilerplate uses OpenAI's response API for tool execution. You'll need:

1. **OpenAI API Key** - Get one at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Public MCP URL** - For OpenAI to call your local tools

### Environment setup
```bash
cp env.development.example .env
# Add your OpenAI API key:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### Mcp server public access
OpenAI needs a public URL to call your MCP server tools:

```bash
# Install ngrok (if not installed)
brew install ngrok  # or download from https://ngrok.com

# Expose MCP server
ngrok http 11233

# Add the ngrok URL to .env:
RESTACK_ENGINE_MCP_ADDRESS=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app
```


## Getting started tutorial

### Step 1: Try a demo agent
1. Open Agent Orchestration at http://localhost:3000
2. Login with demo credentials: `demo@example.com` / `password`
3. Navigate to "Tasks" and select any completed task to see agent conversations
4. Go to "Agents" to see 5 pre-configured agents across different teams

### Step 2: Give an agent a new task
1. Select the "Customer Support" agent
2. Click "Create Task" and describe an issue: *"Customer can't log in to mobile app"*
3. Watch the agent analyze the problem and suggest solutions
4. See how it uses tools like Zendesk and knowledge base

### Step 3: Test agent improvements (no engineering required)
1. Click "Edit Agent" to change instructions
2. Try: *"Always ask for the customer's device type before troubleshooting"*
3. Open the **Playground** to test your changes
4. Send the same login issue and see the improved response
5. Click "Publish Version" to make it live

This workflow demonstrates the product-engineering partnership: product teams can iterate on agent behavior without touching code.

## Adding custom integrations

Build integrations in the **MCP Server** using Restack workflows with Pydantic types. Each function needs both a workflow and function definition to become an agent tool.

### Example: Zendesk integration (mock included)

```python
# apps/mcp_server/src/functions/zendesk.py
from pydantic import BaseModel

class SearchTicketsInput(BaseModel):
    query: str

class TicketResult(BaseModel):
    id: str
    subject: str
    status: str

async def search_zendesk_tickets(input: SearchTicketsInput) -> list[TicketResult]:
    """Search Zendesk tickets by query"""
    # Mock implementation included for demo
    return [
        TicketResult(id="12345", subject="Login issues", status="open"),
        TicketResult(id="12346", subject="Mobile app crash", status="pending")
    ]
```

```python
# apps/mcp_server/src/workflows/zendesk.py
from restack_ai import workflow

@workflow.defn(name="search_zendesk_tickets")
class SearchZendeskTicketsWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, input: SearchTicketsInput) -> list[TicketResult]:
        return await workflow.step(search_zendesk_tickets, input)
```

### How it works
1. Create function with Pydantic types in `apps/mcp_server/src/functions/`
2. Create matching workflow in `apps/mcp_server/src/workflows/`
3. The MCP server auto-discovers workflows as agent tools
4. Test in the playground, no restart needed

See `apps/mcp_server/README.md` for more integration examples.

## Production deployment

### Option 1: Self-hosted Kubernetes (Enterprise)
Deploy on your own Kubernetes cluster:
```bash
# Add Restack Helm repository
helm repo add restack https://github.com/restackio/helm

# Deploy with your configuration
helm install restack restack/restack -f values.yaml
```
See [Restack Helm Charts](https://github.com/restackio/helm) for full configuration options.

### Option 2: Restack Cloud (recommended)
Fully managed infrastructure:
1. Sign up at [console.restack.io](https://console.restack.io)
2. Deploy your agent workflows
3. Connect your frontend to the managed backend

### Option 3: Hybrid (frontend + cloud backend)
**Frontend (Vercel)**
1. Connect your GitHub repo to Vercel
2. Set build settings:
   - Root Directory: `apps/frontend`
   - Build Command: `turbo run build --filter=boilerplate-frontend`

**Backend (Restack Cloud)**
- Deploy backend and MCP server to Restack Cloud
- Update frontend environment variables to point to cloud endpoints

### Option 4: Self-hosted Docker (Hobbyist)
```bash
# Production with Docker Compose
pnpm prod:up

# Or build and run locally
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Platform management

```bash
# Quick commands
pnpm localsetup          # First time setup (install, infra, migrations, demo data)
pnpm localdev            # Start infrastructure + dev servers
pnpm dev                 # Start all dev servers with hot reloading (infra must be running)

# Infrastructure management
pnpm infra:start         # Start infrastructure (PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Restack)
pnpm infra:stop          # Stop infrastructure
pnpm infra:restart       # Restart infrastructure services
pnpm infra:logs          # View container logs
pnpm infra:ps            # Check service status
pnpm infra:reset         # Complete infrastructure reset (⚠️ destroys data)

# Database operations
pnpm db:migrate          # Run database migrations (uses localhost by default)
pnpm db:demo:insert      # Insert demo data (uses localhost by default)
pnpm postgres:connect    # Connect to PostgreSQL
pnpm clickhouse:connect  # Connect to ClickHouse

# Production (self-hosted Docker)
pnpm build               # Build for production
pnpm prod:up             # Start production services
pnpm prod:down           # Stop production services
pnpm prod:logs           # View production logs
pnpm prod:restart        # Restart production services (backend, mcp, webhook)
